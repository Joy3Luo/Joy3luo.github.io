The first derivative of the function f(x), which we write as f(x) or as $$\frac{df}{dx}$$, is the slope of the tangent lin to the function at the point x. To put this in non-graphical terms, the first derivative tells us how whether a function is increasing or decreasing, and by how much it is increasing or decreasing. This information is reflected in the graph of a function by the slope of the tangent line to a point on the graph, which is sometimes describe as the slope of the function. Positive slope tells us that, as x increases, f(x) also increases. Negative slope tells us that, as x increases, f(x) decreases. Zero slope does not tell us anything in particular: the function may be increasing, decreasing, or at a local maximum or a local minimum at that point. Writing this information in terms of derivatives, we see that:

• if $$\frac{df}{dx}(p)$$ > 0, then f(x) is an increasing function at x = p.
• if $$\frac{df}{dx}(p)$$ < 0, then f(x) is a decreasing function at x = p.
• if $$\frac{df}{dx}(p)$$ = 0, then x = p is called a critical point of f(x), and we do not know anything new about the behavior of f(x) at x = p

For example, take $$f(x) = 3x^3 − 6x^2 + 2x − 1$$. The derivative of f(x) is $$\frac{dy}{dx} = 9x^2 − 12x + 2$$
.
At x = 0, the derivative of f(x) is therefore 2, so we know that f(x) is an increasing function at x = 0. At
x = 1, the derivative of f(x) is $$\frac{df}{dx}(1) = 9 · 1^2 − 12 · 1 + 2 = 9 − 12 + 2 = −1$$
so f(x) is a decreasing function at x = 1.
