&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first derivative of the function $$f(x)$$, which we write as $$f(x)$$ or as $$\frac{df}{dx}$$, is the slope of the tangent lin to the function at the point x. To put this in non-graphical terms, the first derivative tells us how whether a function is increasing or decreasing, and by how much it is increasing or decreasing. This information is reflected in the graph of a function by the slope of the tangent line to a point on the graph, which is sometimes describe as the slope of the function. Positive slope tells us that, as x increases, $$f(x)$$ also increases. Negative slope tells us that, as x increases, $$f(x)$$ decreases. Zero slope does not tell us anything in particular: the function may be increasing, decreasing, or at a local maximum or a local minimum at that point. Writing this information in terms of derivatives, we see that:

• if $$\frac{df}{dx}(p)$$ > 0, then $$f(x)$$ is an increasing function at x = p.<br/>
• if $$\frac{df}{dx}(p)$$ < 0, then $$f(x)$$ is a decreasing function at x = p.<br/>
• if $$\frac{df}{dx}(p)$$ = 0, then x = p is called a critical point of $$f(x)$$, and we do not know anything new about the behavior of $$f(x)$$ at x = p<br/>

 Take $$f(x) = 3x^3 − 6x^2 + 2x − 1$$.<br/> The derivative of $$f(x)$$ is $$\frac{dy}{dx} = 9x^2 − 12x + 2$$.<br/>
At x = 0, the derivative of $$f(x)$$ is therefore 2, so we know that $$f(x)$$ is an increasing function at x = 0.
<br/>Atx = 1, the derivative of $$f(x)$$ is $$\frac{df}{dx}(1) = 9 · 1^2 − 12 · 1 + 2 = 9 − 12 + 2 = −1$$<br/>
so $$f(x)$$ is a decreasing function at x = 1.
